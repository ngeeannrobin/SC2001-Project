# SC2001-Project
A Team Project for SC2001 - Algorithm Design &amp; Analysis

#### Project 1: Integration of Mergesort & Insertion Sort
Exploring a sorting algorithm using a hybrid of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort. <br/><br/>

#### Project 2: Dijkstra's Algorithm
Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm using
1. An adjacency matrix to represent the graph and an array for the priority queue, and
2. An array of adjacency lists to represent the graph and a minimising heap for the priority queue.
